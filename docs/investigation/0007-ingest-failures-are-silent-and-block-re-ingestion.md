## Question

While testing the EKS deployment, an ingest job died with a single log line —
`asynq: WARN: Retry exhausted for task id=ingest:<owner>/<name>` — and **no
error appeared anywhere**: not in the pod logs, not on the webhook deliveries
(GitHub showed every POST answered 202). Three questions:

1. Where did the actual error go?
2. Why doesn't anything check the outbound GitHub path (App credentials),
   when the inbound path (webhooks) is visibly healthy?
3. After retries exhaust, does anything recover the repo, or is it stuck?

## Hypothesis

Initial suspicion: the errors are logged somewhere we weren't looking
(a different stream or level), and recovery is automatic on the next push
because enqueue-coalescing treats a duplicate task id as success.

Both halves turned out **wrong**, the second one badly: the errors are
logged *nowhere*, and the coalescing behavior is precisely what *prevents*
recovery.

## Context

**Triggered by:** the first EKS test deployment (chart 0.4.0, Okta login via
Gateway API + ALB). After fixing the auth topology (`AUTH_REDIRECT_BASE`
must be the docz-**site** host, since docz-site is a BFF proxy for
`/auth/`+`/api/`), the first repo ingest failed all five attempts. The only
observable signal was the terminal asynq WARN line.

Phase 4 (CLAUDE.md) documents the intended failure model: "any ingest error
is returned so asynq retries with backoff (the content-hash gate makes
retries idempotent)". This investigation is about what happens *around* that
model — visibility of the error and life after the last retry.

Scope was extended in the same session to two adjacent questions raised by
the first-setup experience: **(a)** can the read surface run with *no* login
auth so first setup only fights GitHub App credentials (F6), and **(b)** is
the F1/F2 silent-error shape a one-off or a repo-wide pattern in conflict
with the error-handling conventions (F7 — full sweep of `internal/` +
`cmd/`)?

## Approach

1. Read `internal/queue/worker.go` / `client.go` for what we log and what
   options we enqueue with.
2. Read asynq v0.26.0 source (module cache) for what the processor logs on
   handler failure, where the error string goes, and what the task-id
   uniqueness check actually tests.
3. Map the enqueue path's `ErrTaskIDConflict` handling against the archived
   state's lifetime.
4. Inventory what does/doesn't exercise GitHub App credentials outside a job.

## Environment

| Component | Version / Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| asynq | `v0.26.0` (read from the module cache) |
| queue name / task type / task id | `ingest` / `ingest:repo` / `ingest:<owner>/<name>` |
| enqueue options | `TaskID` + `ProcessIn(debounce)` + `MaxRetry(5)` + `Retention(24h)` |
| deployment | EKS, chart 0.4.0, image v0.5.1 |

## Findings

### F1 — asynq never logs the handler's error unless an ErrorHandler is set

`processor.handleFailedMessage` (asynq v0.26.0, `processor.go:335`) is the
only place a failed handler return lands:

- it calls `Config.ErrorHandler` **if one is set** (`processor.go:336-338`);
- otherwise a mid-flight failure schedules the retry with **no log at all**
  (`processor.go:347` → `retry`), and the final failure logs only
  `Retry exhausted for task id=...` (`processor.go:344`) — the id, never the
  error text.

Our `queue.NewWorker` sets no `ErrorHandler`. So an ingest that fails five
times produces exactly one WARN line containing zero diagnostic content.
The user-visible symptom — "webhooks all green, no errors anywhere, repo
never ingests" — is the designed-in output of this configuration.

### F2 — Our worker's no-log-here comment codifies a false assumption

`internal/queue/worker.go:106-107`, at the failure site in `handleIngest`:

> The span, the failure metric, and the returned error (which asynq logs
> with the repo-labeled context) carry the signal; don't also log here.

The parenthetical is **false** (F1): asynq does not log returned errors.
The failure site deliberately skips `slog` on the strength of behavior the
library doesn't have. The two signals that *do* exist need optional backends
the test cluster doesn't run:

- the span records the error — visible only with an OTLP collector + trace
  backend (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` unset ⇒ dropped);
- `docz_api_ingest_jobs_total{status="failure"}` increments — visible only
  with Prometheus scraping, and alerting only with the chart's
  `DoczAPIIngestFailures` rule deployed.

Logs were the one channel guaranteed to exist, and they're the one channel
the failure never reaches.

### F3 — The error text lives only in Redis, on the task record

`processor.retry` passes `e.Error()` to `broker.Retry` (`processor.go:360`),
which stores it on the task hash; archived tasks keep it. So the root cause
of any exhausted ingest is recoverable — just not from logs:

```bash
# via the asynq CLI (shows last error per task)
asynq task ls --queue=ingest --state=archived

# zero-install: the error string is embedded readably in the encoded msg
redis-cli HGET 'asynq:{ingest}:t:ingest:<owner>/<name>' msg | strings
```

### F4 — An exhausted task silently swallows every future ingest for that repo

Three verified facts compose into the trap:

1. `EnqueueIngest` uses the **fixed** id `ingest:<owner>/<name>` and maps
   `ErrTaskIDConflict`/`ErrDuplicateTask` to **nil** — coalesce-as-success
   (`internal/queue/client.go:87-96`).
2. asynq's enqueue uniqueness check is a bare `EXISTS` on the task key
   (`internal/rdb/rdb.go:98-108`, `enqueueCmd`), and that key exists in
   **every** state — including `archived`.
3. Archived tasks live **90 days** (`internal/rdb/rdb.go:841`,
   `archivedExpirationInDays`). The `Retention(24h)` we set applies only to
   *completed* tasks; it does not touch the archive.

Composed: once a repo's ingest exhausts its retries, every subsequent
webhook push, `repo_added`, or `-onboard` for that repo enqueues, hits the
archived task's id, is reported as success, and **does nothing — for up to
90 days**. Fixing the root cause (e.g. correcting a bad credential) does not
resurrect the repo; the operator must manually delete or re-run the archived
task. Nothing logs that the swallow happened.

Coalesce-as-success is the right semantics against a *pending/scheduled*
task (the pending job will cover the trigger). It is the wrong semantics
against a *dead* one (nothing will).

### F5 — Nothing validates GitHub App credentials before first use

Webhook deliveries being green proves only the **inbound** path: GitHub can
reach us and the HMAC matches. The App private key and app id are exercised
exclusively on the **outbound** path — JWT → installation token → contents
fetch — which runs only inside a worker job. Consequences:

- A wrong/mangled `private-key` or `app-id` (typical when moving to a new
  secret provider) surfaces as five silent job failures (F1) followed by a
  90-day swallow (F4) — never as a startup or readiness error.
- `/readyz` checks postgres/meilisearch/redis only. That scope is
  **deliberate and correct**: readiness gates request routing, and GitHub
  being down should not pull the read API out of rotation. The gap is not
  in readyz — it's that no *startup self-check* (e.g. authenticate the App
  JWT against `GET /app`) exists to fail loudly at deploy time.

### F6 — A no-auth mode is feasible: login auth and App auth are independent

The first-setup friction ("fighting the login auth and the GitHub auth at
the same time") rests on a coupling that **does not exist in the code**. The
GitHub App credentials (JWT → installation token → contents fetch) never
touch the login flow: ingest works with zero users logged in. Site login
gates only the *read* API. The two systems are required simultaneously only
because configuration says so:

- `internal/config/validate.go:49-51` hard-fails on an empty
  `AUTH_PROVIDERS` ("at least one provider is required"), and each enabled
  provider drags in its credential trio plus `AUTH_REDIRECT_BASE` (:55) and
  `SESSION_SECRET` (:35).
- The gate is a single composition point in `runServer`
  (`session.Middleware ∘ authorize.Middleware`). The authorize half is
  already the all-repos pass-through seam (DESIGN-0001 Decision 10), so a
  no-auth mode swaps only the session half for an anonymous-identity
  injector — nothing downstream changes.
- **docz-site needs no changes.** The SPA shows the login panel purely in
  reaction to a 401 (`src/api/fetcher.ts:25-31`, `SessionRequiredError`);
  if the API never 401s, the login UI is unreachable. Only the session menu
  cosmetically reflects an anonymous identity. (`parseProviders` can never
  return an empty list — it falls back to a GitHub button — but that UI
  never renders in this mode.)
- **The chart is nearly free by construction**: `docz-api.authProviders`
  gates provider env blocks and Secret keys on known names, so
  `config.authProviders: "none"` renders no provider config at all. Only
  the unconditional `required` on `config.authRedirectBase` needs gating.

Caveat that must ship with the feature: `none` means anyone who can reach
the site reads every onboarded repo's docs. It is a loud, documented opt-in
for tailnet/internal deployments and first-boot smoke tests. The webhook's
HMAC auth is unaffected.

### F7 — The silent-sink pattern recurs at four more operational choke points

A full sweep of every non-test Go file under `internal/` and `cmd/` (55
files, 20 packages) checked the F1/F2 shape everywhere: a wrapped `%w`
error chain terminating in a sink that structurally cannot report it. The
`_ =` class is extinct (`errcheck` runs with `check-blank: true`), and the
deferred-cleanup paths are exemplary (`store/reconcile.go:23-30` is the
counter-example to cite: rollback folded into the named return, gated on a
`committed` flag). The pattern survives at the sinks:

1. **`internal/authorize/authorize.go:52`** — the middleware 500s on an
   `Authorizer.Allowed` error and drops it. The production chain is
   `AllReposAuthorizer` → `store` `"list repos: %w"` — so a Postgres outage
   on the hot `/api/v1` path is a stream of 500s with **zero** server-side
   record. Every sibling 500 path (`httpapi.serverError`,
   `authhttp.serverError`) logs; this one cannot. The strongest parallel to
   the worker bug.
2. **`internal/session/middleware.go:33-35`** — `Lookup` errors collapse to
   a 401 with no `errors.Is(ErrSessionNotFound)` discrimination. Redis down
   ⇒ every authenticated user gets silently logged out and the logs show
   only a 401 storm; infra failure and corrupt session JSON deserve
   `slog.Error`/`Warn`.
3. **`internal/webhook/webhook.go:126` (and :96)** — a `ParseWebHook`
   failure is discarded, but it fires **after** HMAC verification, so the
   payload provably came from GitHub: it means go-github schema drift or an
   unsubscribed event — real and actionable. The adjacent `RecordDelivery`
   / `route` branches both `slog.Error`. Same for the body read at :96,
   where a >5 MiB `MaxBytesReader` trip 400s indistinguishably from a hung
   client.
4. **`internal/httpapi/handler.go:112-113`** and
   **`internal/authhttp/handler.go:90-91`** — every JSON response funnels
   through a `json.Marshal` whose failure 500s without logging, while a
   suitable `serverError` helper already exists in both files.
5. **`internal/queue/worker.go:54-59`** — beyond the missing
   `ErrorHandler` (F1), `asynq.Config.Logger` is also unset, so asynq's
   *internal* errors (e.g. the processor's "Dequeue error" — how a Redis
   outage in the worker poller manifests) print unstructured plaintext to
   stderr, bypassing the slog JSON handler — unparseable in a JSON log
   pipeline. Both fixes are the same change site.
6. **`internal/queue/client.go:95`** — the coalesce branch logs at
   **Debug**, but it also swallows the documented active-window gap
   (`client.go:70-73`): a trigger arriving while a job is *running* is
   dropped, not coalesced (asynq holds the task id until completion). The
   one place a push can legitimately vanish is invisible at default log
   level — and F4 makes the same branch the 90-day swallow.

Minor notes: `.golangci.yml` carries a latent `(io.Closer).Close` errcheck
exclusion (no current hits) and a stale `G104` rule for files that don't
exist; `search/client.go:42-47` discards the index-create task by design
(expected to fail on an existing index) which also hides an *unexpected*
create failure; `httpapi/typeresolver.go:26` skips corrupt alias JSONB with
a bare `continue`. All post-`WriteHeader` write-failure logs are
consistently Debug — correct.

## Conclusion

**Answer:** all three questions resolve against us, by construction.

1. The error goes to the Redis task record only (F1/F3); logs get a bare
   "Retry exhausted" because we never installed the `ErrorHandler` our own
   comment assumes exists (F2).
2. Nothing checks outbound GitHub because credentials are only exercised
   inside jobs and no boot-time self-check exists; webhook health is
   evidence about the wrong direction (F5).
3. Nothing recovers. Worse than nothing: the archived task blocks and
   silently discards all re-ingestion triggers for that repo for up to
   90 days (F4).

On the extended scope: the worker bug is not a one-off — the same
wrapped-chain-into-a-mute-sink shape exists at four more operational choke
points, all of them exactly where an infra outage would need logs most
(F7). And a no-auth first-setup mode is a genuinely small change because
the seams were built for it; only configuration insists both auth systems
exist (F6).

## Recommendation

Code fixes, in value order — all small:

1. **Install `asynq.Config.ErrorHandler`** in `queue.NewWorker`, slog-ing
   every failed attempt (task id, repo, retry count, error). Correct the
   false comment in `handleIngest` at the same time. This restores the
   behavior the code already believes it has.
2. **Startup App-auth self-check**: mint the App JWT and call `GET /app`
   once during boot; log the authenticated app slug or fail loudly.
   Turns "5 silent failures + 90-day swallow" into a deploy-time error.
3. **Un-swallow the archived case**: on `ErrTaskIDConflict`, distinguish a
   live pending/scheduled task (coalesce, as today) from an archived one
   (delete-and-re-enqueue, or at minimum log loudly). An
   `Inspector.GetTaskInfo` state check on the conflict path is enough.
4. **Log at the four mute sinks** (F7): `authorize` middleware logs the
   `Allowed` error before its 500; `session.Middleware` discriminates
   `ErrSessionNotFound` (401, quiet) from infra/decode errors (log +
   arguably 500, since "Redis down" is not "logged out"); `webhook`
   logs `ParseWebHook` and body-read failures; `httpapi`/`authhttp`
   `writeJSON` routes through the existing `serverError` helpers.
5. **Set `asynq.Config.Logger`** to an slog adapter in the same change as
   the `ErrorHandler` (F7.5) so asynq's internals land in the structured
   pipeline, and raise the coalesce log to Info (F7.6).
6. **`AUTH_PROVIDERS=none` mode** (F6): relax `validate.go` (skip provider,
   redirect-base, and session-secret requirements under `none`), swap the
   session gate for an anonymous-identity injector in `runServer`, gate the
   chart's `authRedirectBase` `required`, and document it as a loud opt-in
   for internal/first-boot deployments.

## Recovery runbook (as-is, no code changes)

1. Read the stored error: `asynq task ls --queue=ingest --state=archived`
   (CLI: `go install github.com/hibiken/asynq/tools/asynq@latest`, point it
   at the Valkey service — port-forward works).
2. Fix the root cause it names.
3. Clear the blocker — either re-run the archived task (safe: the payload
   carries no SHA; the worker refetches HEAD) or delete it and push again:
   `redis-cli DEL 'asynq:{ingest}:t:ingest:<owner>/<name>'`.

## Open questions

- **OQ-1** — root cause of the triggering EKS failure: not yet retrieved
  from the archived task record (runbook step 1). Ranked suspects, in
  order: mangled `private-key` PEM in the new external Secret; blocked
  egress to `api.github.com`; repo missing `.docz.yaml` (a *permanent*
  failure that retries can never fix); installation-id mismatch.
- **OQ-2** — should the boot self-check fail startup or warn-only?
  Fail-fast matches the OIDC-discovery precedent (a bad issuer fails the
  boot); warn-only keeps the read API serving when only ingest is broken.
- **OQ-3** — fix 3's mechanism: enqueue-side `GetTaskInfo`+delete, vs a
  worker-side `DeleteTask` after archiving, vs shortening the archive TTL.
  Enqueue-side is the least magical and keeps the decision at the choke
  point that owns the TaskID scheme.
- **OQ-4** — spelling of the no-auth switch: `AUTH_PROVIDERS=none` (one
  knob, reads naturally in the existing enum) vs a separate
  `AUTH_DISABLED=true`. Also: should `/auth/login` 404 or 503 in that
  mode? `none`-in-the-existing-knob is the leading option.
- **OQ-5** — the active-window drop (`client.go:70-73`): does it get a
  real fix (track a dirty flag / re-enqueue after run completion) or just
  the louder log from fix 5? A push landing mid-ingest is rare but is a
  genuine lost-trigger path independent of F4.
