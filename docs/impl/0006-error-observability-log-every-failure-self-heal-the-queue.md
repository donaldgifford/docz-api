## Objective

Implement INV-0007's recommendations so that **no error terminates in a sink
that cannot report it**, the queue **recovers on its own** after retry
exhaustion, credential problems surface **at boot**, and first setup can
optionally skip login auth entirely. The acceptance bar is INV-0007's own
origin story run in reverse: a deliberately failing ingest must be fully
diagnosable **from structured logs alone** — no `redis-cli`, no asynq CLI, no
decoding a stored task record — and a fixed root cause must self-heal on the
next trigger without an operator touching Valkey.

**Implements:** INV-0007 recommendations 1–6 (F1–F7)

## Scope

### In Scope

- `asynq.Config.ErrorHandler` + `Logger` (slog adapter) + `LogLevel` in
  `internal/queue`; correct the false comment at the `handleIngest` failure
  site; raise the coalesce log to Info.
- Archived-task conflict handling on the enqueue path (`Inspector` check →
  delete + re-enqueue), killing the 90-day silent swallow (F4).
- Boot-time GitHub App self-check (`AppsTransport` JWT → `GET /app`) in
  `internal/githubapp`, wired into `run()`.
- Logging at the four mute HTTP sinks (F7): `authorize` middleware, `session`
  middleware (with `ErrSessionNotFound` discrimination), `webhook` body-read +
  payload-parse, `writeJSON` in `httpapi`/`authhttp`.
- `AUTH_PROVIDERS=none` (F6): config validation, anonymous-session gate,
  chart gating, docs. SPA untouched by design.
- Deliberate-failure verification + the EKS redeploy that closes INV-0007
  OQ-1 from logs.

### Out of Scope

- The active-window drop's *mechanical* fix (INV-0007 OQ-5) — this plan makes
  it **visible** (Info log), not impossible; see OQ-6 below.
- Periodic full resync / webhook replay (the standing backstop idea from the
  funnel incidents) — separate feature, separate doc.
- RFC 7807 error envelopes, log sampling, or any log-pipeline work.
- Tailscale/ingress topology changes (handled elsewhere).

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Queue failure visibility — ErrorHandler, Logger, comment fix

The one-change-site fix for F1 + F7.5: every failed attempt logs through
slog, and asynq's internal errors stop bypassing the structured pipeline.

#### Tasks

- [x] Add an slog-backed `asynq.Logger` adapter in `internal/queue`
      (five methods, `Debug`…`Fatal`; map `Fatal` → `slog.Error` since slog
      has no fatal level and asynq only calls it during startup config
      validation). Set `Logger` + `LogLevel` (map from `LOG_LEVEL`) in the
      `asynq.Config` at `worker.go:54-59`.
- [x] Add `ErrorHandler: asynq.ErrorHandlerFunc(...)` in the same `Config`
      block: `slog.Error("ingest job failed", "task_id", …, "type",
      task.Type(), "err", err)` — unmarshal the payload for `repo`/`reason`
      attrs when it parses (best-effort; never fail the handler on a
      malformed payload).
- [x] Rewrite the false comment at `worker.go:106-107` to state the real
      contract: the returned error reaches asynq, which hands it to **our**
      `ErrorHandler` (F1: asynq itself never logs it).
- [x] Raise the coalesce log at `client.go:95` from Debug to Info and extend
      its message to name the active-window caveat (`client.go:70-73`), so
      the one place a push can vanish is visible at default log level.
- [x] Unit tests: capture slog output (swap `slog.SetDefault` handler for a
      recording one) — a failing fake ingestor produces an ErrorHandler line
      per attempt carrying repo + error; the Logger adapter routes asynq
      levels to slog levels.

#### Success Criteria

- A job that fails N attempts emits N structured `ingest job failed` lines
  (repo, reason, error) plus the terminal archive WARN — proven by a queue
  integration test asserting on captured log records.
- `LOG_FORMAT=json` produces **zero** non-JSON lines from the queue
  subsystem under a Redis outage (asynq's "Dequeue error" path now routes
  through the adapter) — proven by stopping the testcontainer Redis
  mid-test and scanning stderr.
- `just ci` green.

**Phase 1 complete (2026-08-24).** All five tasks done; `just ci` green;
`golangci-lint --build-tags=integration` clean. Two criteria were met by a
different proof than written, deliberately:

- **"N lines for N attempts"** is proven for the **first** attempt only
  (`TestFailedIngestLogsTheError`). asynq's default retry backoff is tens of
  seconds per step, so asserting all five would make the test run for
  minutes. The hook is per-attempt by construction (asynq calls
  `ErrorHandler` from `handleFailedMessage`, on every failure including the
  last), so one real attempt through real Redis proves the wiring; the
  multi-attempt lifecycle is covered end-to-end by the Phase 6 drill.
- **JSON purity** is proven structurally rather than by scanning stderr:
  `TestAsynqInternalErrorsReachSlog` points a worker at an unreachable Redis
  and asserts `component=asynq` records arrive through slog. Setting
  `Config.Logger` means asynq has no path to stderr at all, so this asserts
  the cause rather than the symptom — and it avoids stopping the container
  `TestMain` shares with every other case in the package.

### Phase 2: Queue self-heal — un-swallow the archived-task conflict

Kills F4: retry exhaustion must never silently eat future triggers.

#### Tasks

- [x] Add an `*asynq.Inspector` to `queue.Client` (same parsed redis opts;
      close it in `Client.Close` via the existing `errors.Join`).
- [x] On `ErrTaskIDConflict`/`ErrDuplicateTask` in `EnqueueIngest`: call
      `Inspector.GetTaskInfo(queueName, taskID)`. State
      pending/scheduled/retry → today's coalesce (now Info, Phase 1). State
      **archived** → `DeleteTask` + re-enqueue once (single retry, no loop);
      log Info `"archived ingest task cleared; re-enqueued"`. State
      **active** → keep coalesce semantics but log the drop caveat (OQ-6
      defers the mechanical fix). `GetTaskInfo` error → log Warn, treat as
      coalesced (fail open: never turn a webhook 202 into a 500 over an
      inspection).
- [x] Unit test the state-dispatch with a fake inspector seam (consumer-side
      interface, matching house style).
- [x] Integration test (`queue_integration_test.go`, real Redis): drive a
      task to archived via a failing fake ingestor, then enqueue the same
      repo → assert the archived task is deleted, a fresh task runs, and
      the success path completes. Assert the pending-state coalesce still
      works (existing burst test keeps passing).

#### Success Criteria

- The INV-0007 F4 scenario is dead: after retry exhaustion, the **next**
  trigger ingests (proven by the new integration test), with an Info line
  explaining what happened.
- No behavior change for the healthy coalesce path (existing debounce/burst
  integration tests unchanged and green).

**Phase 2 complete (2026-08-24).** All four tasks done; unit + integration
suites and `golangci-lint --build-tags=integration` green.

**Scope grew during implementation.** Probing the conflict path turned up a
second, worse instance of the same trap, now recorded as INV-0007 **F4b**:
`Retention(24h)` made asynq keep the task key after every *successful* run
(`markAsComplete` HSETs the key; the no-retention path DELs it), so the
completed state held the repo's id for 24 hours and every push in that
window was silently dropped — **one ingest per repo per day, on the happy
path**. `TestReingestAfterSuccessfulRun` fails against the pre-fix code.

The fix therefore covers both terminal states rather than archived alone,
and drops `Retention` so a success frees the id immediately; the inspector
path still clears ids left behind by earlier deployments. The decision is a
pure `classifyConflict` function so the state table is unit-tested directly
rather than through a re-implementation.

`TestReingestAfterArchivedRun` archives the task via the inspector instead
of waiting out five retries of asynq's default backoff, which would take
minutes.

### Phase 3: Boot-time GitHub App credential self-check

F5's fix: bad App credentials fail the deploy, not the fifth silent retry.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Add `githubapp.SelfCheck(ctx, appID, pemKey, apiBase) (slug string,
      err error)`: `ghinstallation.NewAppsTransport` (app JWT, not an
      installation transport) → go-github `Apps.Get(ctx, "")` → return the
      app slug. Honor `apiBase` exactly as `NewClient` does.
- [ ] Wire into `run()` after config load, bounded by a short context
      (reuse the `oidcDiscoveryTimeout` precedent): log
      `"github app authenticated" slug=…` on success; on failure apply the
      OQ-1 decision (recommendation: fail boot on credential rejection,
      warn-and-continue on transport errors, discriminated via
      `*github.ErrorResponse` status).
- [ ] Skip the check in `-migrate` mode (no GitHub involvement); run it for
      serve and `-onboard`.
- [ ] Unit tests with a stub `http.RoundTripper` (house pattern from
      `githubapp`): 200 → slug; 401 → credential-shaped error; connection
      refused → transport-shaped error.
- [ ] Document the health-check trio in `deploy/README.md` (and the chart
      README's probes note): `/healthz` = liveness ("pod is up", bare
      200); `/readyz` = readiness ("dependencies connected, can accept
      traffic" — postgres/meili/redis, 503 names the offender); the boot
      self-check = startup credential validation (crashes the boot on bad
      creds, in **neither** probe — GitHub down must not pull the read
      API from rotation).

#### Success Criteria

- A deploy with a mangled PEM or wrong app id logs one unambiguous
  credential error at boot and (per OQ-1a) exits nonzero — observable in
  `kubectl logs` within seconds of pod start, no ingest attempt needed.
- A valid deploy logs the authenticated app slug once at startup.
- GitHub being temporarily unreachable does not crash-loop an otherwise
  healthy API (transport errors warn only).

### Phase 4: The four mute HTTP sinks

F7's fix: every wrapped error chain now terminates in a logging sink.

#### Tasks

- [ ] `internal/authorize/authorize.go:52` — `slog.Error("authorize failed",
      "err", err)` before the 500. (The chain carries the store context;
      nothing else needed.)
- [ ] `internal/session/middleware.go:33-35` — discriminate:
      `errors.Is(err, ErrSessionNotFound)` → 401 quietly (expected churn);
      anything else (Redis down, corrupt JSON) → `slog.Error` + the OQ-2
      status decision (recommendation: 503 with the standard error
      envelope, because "session backend down" is not "logged out").
- [ ] `internal/webhook/webhook.go:96` — log Warn on body-read failure
      (names the `MaxBytesReader` cap case); `:126` — log Error on
      `ParseWebHook` failure with the event header (post-HMAC ⇒ provably
      GitHub ⇒ schema drift or unsubscribed event).
- [ ] `internal/httpapi/handler.go:112-113` and
      `internal/authhttp/handler.go:90-91` — route marshal failures through
      the existing `serverError` helpers (which log) instead of the silent
      `writeError`/inline 500. Leave the error-envelope-marshal fallback
      (`authhttp:105`) as-is but add a `slog.Error` (practically
      unreachable; one line buys completeness).
- [ ] Unit tests per sink with a recording slog handler: erroring fake
      authorizer / lookuper / marshal-poisoned DTO (`json.RawMessage` with
      invalid bytes) each produce exactly one error record; the
      session-middleware test pins 401-stays-quiet for
      `ErrSessionNotFound`.
- [ ] Contract test still green; if OQ-2a (503) is chosen, confirm the spec
      needs no change (the contract test exercises defined scenarios only;
      5xx paths are not specced per-op today).

#### Success Criteria

- A Postgres outage on `/api/v1` and a Redis outage on the session gate
  each produce structured error logs naming the failing dependency (proven
  by unit tests; observed live in Phase 6).
- Review of the four cited sites shows no error path that neither logs nor
  delegates to a logging helper; `just lint` green.
- 401 behavior for genuinely missing/expired sessions is byte-identical
  (contract test unchanged on that path).

### Phase 5: AUTH_PROVIDERS=none — first-setup no-auth mode

F6: one knob to run the read surface open, so first setup fights only the
GitHub App credentials. Loud opt-in, documented as such.

#### Tasks

- [ ] `internal/config`: accept the literal `none` in `AUTH_PROVIDERS`
      (OQ-3 spelling). `validate.go`: under `none` (which must be the
      *only* entry — `none,okta` is a config error), skip provider
      credential checks, `AUTH_REDIRECT_BASE`, and `SESSION_SECRET`
      requirements. Add an `AuthDisabled()` helper alongside
      `AuthEnabled`.
- [ ] `cmd/docz-api`: when disabled, `buildAuthProviders` returns an empty
      registry; `runServer` swaps `session.Middleware` for an
      anonymous-identity injector (synthetic `session.Session` with
      provider `none`, subject `anonymous`, injected via the same ctx key
      so `FromContext` and `/api/v1/auth/session` work unchanged) composed
      over the same `authorize.Middleware`. Skip `MountPublic` (no
      `/auth/login`/`/auth/callback` routes — 404, the absent-route
      precedent from search; OQ-4). Log one startup Warn:
      `"auth disabled (AUTH_PROVIDERS=none): the read API is open"`.
- [ ] Session store: still constructed (Redis is required anyway for the
      queue) but the cookie path is never exercised; logout becomes a no-op
      revoke on the synthetic id — verify it 200s harmlessly rather than
      500s.
- [ ] Chart: gate the `required` on `config.authRedirectBase` (and the
      session-secret Secret key) off `has "none" $providers`; extend the
      `docz-api.authProviders` helper docs; `values.yaml` comment block +
      README.md.gotmpl section documenting the exposure caveat;
      helm-unittest cases (none-mode renders no provider env, no
      oauth/okta/keycloak Secret keys, no authRedirectBase requirement).
- [ ] Contract test: a none-mode handler variant asserting `/api/v1` reads
      succeed with no cookie and `/api/v1/auth/session` returns the
      synthetic identity (spec shape unchanged — `sessionDTO` already fits;
      no spec version bump expected, confirm during implementation).
- [ ] Docs: `deploy/README.md` first-setup section rewritten to lead with
      none-mode ("get ingest working first, add login after"), plus the
      revert path (set real providers, redeploy).

#### Success Criteria

- `AUTH_PROVIDERS=none` with **no** session secret, redirect base, or
  provider credentials boots clean, serves `/api/v1` reads without a
  cookie, and returns the synthetic identity on `/api/v1/auth/session` —
  proven by the contract-test variant.
- Default (`github`) behavior is byte-identical: full test suite + contract
  test green with no fixture churn outside the new none-mode cases.
- `just helm-unittest` green with the new cases; a none-mode
  `helm template` renders no provider env vars and no provider Secret keys.
- The docz-site, pointed at a none-mode API, renders docs with no login
  panel (manual smoke; the SPA's login UI is 401-driven and none-mode
  never 401s).

### Phase 6: Deliberate-failure verification, deploy, close-out

INV-0007's origin story, rerun against the fixed binary — the phase that
proves "we are actually covering the error exposure required" instead of
assuming it.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Local deliberate-failure drill (compose stack): onboard a repo whose
      fetch **must** fail (no `.docz.yaml`), watch `just run` logs only:
      confirm N per-attempt error lines with the real cause, the terminal
      archive WARN, and — after "fixing" the repo — a next trigger that
      self-heals through the Phase 2 path. **No Redis inspection allowed**;
      if any step needs it, that's a Phase 1/2 bug to fix before shipping.
- [ ] Repeat the drill with `LOG_FORMAT=json` piped through `jq -e` to
      prove every queue-subsystem line parses (Phase 1's second criterion,
      end to end).
- [ ] Release: minor version bump (new env mode + logging surface), chart
      version bump for the Phase 5 template changes; `pr-semver` label
      `minor`.
- [ ] EKS redeploy of the new image + chart; re-trigger the INV-0007
      failing repo; **close INV-0007 OQ-1 from the logs** — record the
      actual root cause in INV-0007 (edit the OQ, note "answered via the
      Phase 6 deploy").
- [ ] Close-out: mark INV-0007 recommendations 1–6 as implemented in the
      INV; update CLAUDE.md (new conventions: asynq Logger/ErrorHandler
      contract, SelfCheck at boot, none-mode); `docz update`.

#### Success Criteria

- The full failure lifecycle — first failure, every retry, exhaustion,
  root-cause identification, fix, self-heal — is reconstructed **from
  structured logs alone** in both drills. Valkey is never opened.
- INV-0007 OQ-1 is answered and recorded, from production logs, not from
  the stored task record.
- CI green, release published, EKS running the new version with the
  failing repo ingested (or its genuine blocker named in the logs).

## Testing Plan

- **Log assertions** are the novel surface: a small recording
  `slog.Handler` helper (swapped via `slog.SetDefault`, restored per test)
  shared by the queue/middleware/sink tests. Standard library only, per
  house rules.
- **Queue**: unit (adapter level-mapping, ErrorHandler attrs, conflict
  state-dispatch on a fake inspector) + integration (real Redis: archived
  self-heal, burst coalesce regression, JSON-purity under Redis outage).
- **githubapp**: stub RoundTripper trio (200 / 401 / connection refused).
- **Sinks**: one unit test per sink asserting exactly one error record and
  unchanged HTTP behavior (except the OQ-2 decision, pinned by its own
  test).
- **none-mode**: contract-test variant (open reads + synthetic session) and
  helm-unittest render cases; default-mode fixtures untouched proves
  no-regression.
- **Phase 6** is manual-but-scripted: both drills recorded in the PR
  description with log excerpts.

## Dependencies

- No new Go modules: `asynq` (ErrorHandler/Logger/Inspector),
  `ghinstallation/v2` (`NewAppsTransport`), go-github (`Apps.Get`) are all
  already direct deps — verified against the module cache
  (asynq `v0.26.0`, ghinstallation `v2.19.0`).
- Chart changes ride the existing helpers (`docz-api.authProviders`).
- Phase 6's EKS step needs the cluster access already in use for testing.

## Open Questions

Numbered for review; `a` is the recommendation. Reply with a letter per
question, or "other: …".

**All answered `a` (2026-08-22).** OQ-1a comes with a probe-semantics note
from review: the operator asked whether `/healthz` vs `/readyz` should be
made more explicit — `/healthz` = "pod is up", `/readyz` = "dependencies
connected, can accept traffic". That is exactly the current semantics
(liveness is a bare 200; readiness checks postgres/meili/redis and 503s
naming the offender), so no endpoint changes — but the distinction gets
**documented**, and the boot self-check is deliberately a *third* thing:
startup credential validation, in **neither** probe. GitHub stays out of
`/readyz` on purpose (readiness gates traffic routing; the read API serves
fine with GitHub down), and a credential failure crashes the boot rather
than flapping readiness. A doc task was added to Phase 3.

1. **Boot self-check failure mode (Phase 3)** — what does a failed
   `GET /app` do to startup?
   - **a. Discriminate: credential rejection (4xx from GitHub) fails the
     boot; transport errors (DNS, refused, timeout) log Warn and
     continue.** Bad creds are permanent and deserve a crash-loop an
     operator sees immediately; a GitHub blip is transient and should not
     take down an otherwise healthy read API. *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. Always fail fast — simplest, matches the OIDC-discovery precedent
     exactly, but a GitHub outage at pod-restart time crash-loops the
     whole API.
   - c. Always warn-only — never blocks a deploy, but a mangled key still
     reaches the first real ingest before anyone notices (a softer version
     of today's F5).

2. **Session-lookup infra errors (Phase 4)** — Redis down / corrupt JSON
   currently 401s. After logging, what status?
   - **a. 503 with the standard `{"error":…}` envelope.** Honest ("service
     can't answer authn right now" ≠ "you are logged out"), and it stops
     the SPA from bouncing users to the login panel during a Redis blip.
     5xx is not per-op specced, so no OpenAPI change. *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. Keep 401, just add the Error log — zero behavior change, but the
     SPA logs everyone out for the duration of any Redis hiccup.
   - c. 500 — same honesty as (a) with a less precise status code.

3. **No-auth switch spelling (Phase 5)** — how does the operator say "no
   login auth"?
   - **a. `AUTH_PROVIDERS=none`, required to be the sole entry.** One
     existing knob, reads naturally next to `github,okta`, impossible to
     enable by omission (the default stays `github`), and the chart's
     provider-gating helper handles it for free. *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. A separate `AUTH_DISABLED=true` boolean — more explicit, but two
     knobs can now contradict each other (`AUTH_DISABLED=true` +
     `AUTH_PROVIDERS=okta`) and both sides need precedence rules.
   - c. Empty `AUTH_PROVIDERS` means disabled — smallest change, but a
     typo'd provider list could silently open the API; `none` keeps
     "open" an explicit word.

4. **`/auth/login` + `/auth/callback` in none-mode (Phase 5)** — mounted
   or not?
   - **a. Not mounted → 404.** The absent-route precedent (the search
     route is absent when no searcher is wired); nothing advertises the
     endpoints, and the SPA never links them (its login UI is 401-driven
     and none-mode never 401s). *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. Mounted, returning 503 + an "auth disabled" envelope — friendlier
     to a human poking with curl, at the cost of a bespoke handler for a
     mode meant to be temporary.

5. **Synthetic identity shape (Phase 5)** — what does
   `/api/v1/auth/session` return in none-mode?
   - **a. `{provider: "none", subject: "anonymous"}` with empty
     email/login/groups**, via the normal `sessionDTO` — the SPA renders
     its session menu unchanged, no spec change. *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. 404/absent endpoint in none-mode — cleaner conceptually, but the
     SPA treats a session-endpoint failure as logged-out and may render
     login affordances that lead nowhere (404 per OQ-4a).

6. **The active-window drop (INV-0007 OQ-5)** — a trigger landing while
   the repo's job is *running* is still dropped (asynq holds the task id
   until completion). This plan logs it (Phase 1); fix it too?
   - **a. Defer to a follow-up.** Rare (requires a push inside the
     seconds-long ingest window), now visible at Info, and an eventual
     periodic-resync backstop erases the class entirely; a dirty-flag
     re-enqueue in the worker completion path is real complexity for a
     shrinking gap. *(Recommended.)* **Answered: (a).**
   - b. Fix now: on active-state conflict, re-enqueue with
     `ProcessIn(debounce)` under a *different* task id (e.g.
     `ingest:<repo>:followup`), accepting the second-slot bookkeeping.
